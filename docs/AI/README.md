# AI Documentation Overview

This directory contains examples, templates, and guidelines for documenting a full-stack project. Each file serves a specific purpose to help keep your work organized, transparent, and maintainable.

---

## File Categories

1. Templates  
   - Provide a consistent blueprint for common documentation types, including changelogs, implementation details, modules, roadmaps, tasks, and thoughts.  
   - Located in docs/AI/templates/*.template.md.  
   - Copy or modify these templates to document new features, modules, or processes.

2. Examples  
   - Illustrate how the templates can be used in actual project documentation.  
   - Located in docs/AI/examples/*.md.  
   - Each example (e.g., Implementation.md, Roadmap.md, Tasks.md) demonstrates best practices and gives a concrete reference to follow.

3. .cursorrules  
   - Outlines rules and conventions for coding, naming, security, documentation, and testing.  
   - Follow them to keep the project consistent, readable, and reliable across the stack.

## Document Types

Below is a brief summary of the different doc types youâ€™ll find here:

1. Changelog (Changelog.template.md)  
   - Tracks version history, new features, changes, fixes, and security patches.  
   - Keep it updated with each release to provide a clear project timeline.

2. Implementation (Implementation.template.md)  
   - Details design decisions, technical specs, database schemas, and API structures.  
   - Explains rationale behind major architectural choices.

3. Roadmap (Roadmap.template.md)  
   - Lays out upcoming milestones, features, and target completion dates.  
   - Helps team members track progress and plan future work.

4. Tasks (Tasks.template.md)  
   - Lists high-priority and in-progress tasks, plus blocked items.  
   - Intended for short-term planning and daily tracking of what needs to be done.

5. Thoughts (Thoughts.template.md)  
   - Serves as a brainstorming log or journal of design considerations and open questions.  
   - Helps capture informal ideas and discussions for future reference.

6. Module (Module.template.md)  
   - Defines the scope, features, and technical setup for a specific module (e.g., AuthModule).  
   - Explains integration points, configuration, and open questions for that module.

7. Session (Session.template.md)  
   - Describes session-based authentication flows, including express-session configuration and best practices for session storage (e.g., in-memory, Redis).  
   - Outlines security considerations such as session cookie settings, session expiration, and how to integrate with Passport (LocalStrategy or JWT).  
   - Helps ensure consistency when handling user sessions across different environments.

## Adding Tests as You Go
In conjunction with our .cursorrules (especially the Testing Rules in section 13), be sure to add or update tests whenever you:
- Implement a new feature  
- Fix a bug or security issue  
- Refactor code or move logic into a new module

This helps maintain a stable and reliable codebase. All test-related details (frameworks, coverage targets, CI integration) should be documented in the relevant sections of your Implementation docs, Roadmap, or Tasks.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Choose the Right Template:  
   - Each template is designed for a specialized purpose (e.g., Implementation, Roadmap). Select the one appropriate for your needs.

2. Keep Docs Updated:  
   - As the project evolves, update relevant documentation to reflect the latest architecture, features, and timelines.

3. Maintain Consistency:  
   - Follow naming conventions, referencing styles, and layout patterns across all documents. This reduces confusion and ensures clarity.

4. Reference and Link:  
   - When a document refers to another (e.g., a Roadmap item linked to an Implementation detail), provide direct links or references to keep context connected.

## Further Resources

- Consult .cursorrules for coding, naming, and documentation standards.  
- Refer to the examples folder (docs/AI/examples) to see how these templates look in practice.  
- Regularly update or version-control your documentation as your project grows.
