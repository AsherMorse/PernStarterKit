## 2024-01-14 Initial Project Setup
- Evaluating project structure and documentation needs:
  - Created organized docs structure for better maintainability
  - Considering best practices for PERN stack organization
  - Need to evaluate TypeScript integration strategy

## Open Questions
- Should we implement TypeScript from the start or migrate later?
- What authentication strategy would work best for our use case?
- How should we handle database migrations and versioning?

## Potential Solutions
- Authentication options:
  - JWT with refresh tokens
  - Session-based with Redis
  - Passport.js with multiple strategies
- Database considerations:
  - Knex.js vs raw SQL for migrations
  - Schema versioning strategy
  - Backup and restore procedures
