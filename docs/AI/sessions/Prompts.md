# Prompt 1: Starting the Session

Before beginning a new session, please:

• Review docs/AI/README.md to ensure you understand the “Usage Guidelines” and overall documentation structure.  
• Familiarize yourself with the Session template (docs/AI/templates/Session.template.md) to maintain consistency.  
• Follow all .cursorrules (naming conventions, security, and documentation) and note any needed updates.

Once you have a clear understanding of these guidelines:

1. Create or open a new session folder using our standard naming convention (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD-title).
2. Copy the Session template into a new session.md file within that folder.
3. Clearly list your goals ([Session Goals]) and outline tasks ([Planned Tasks]) for this session.
4. Confirm that you’ll track progress, decisions, and relevant code changes in the session.md file.
5. Begin the session when all setup steps are complete.

# Prompt 2: During the Session

While you work through this session:

• Regularly update the “Progress Log” in session.md with completed tasks and timestamps.  
• Track key decisions under “Decisions Made” and challenges under “Challenges & Solutions.”  
• Record any documentation changes in “Document Updates,” explaining why the updates were needed.  
• Remember to add or update tests whenever you implement a new feature or fix a bug (see .cursorrules, especially section 13).  
• Maintain consistent naming and structure as outlined in .cursorrules.  
• Commit frequently with clear and descriptive messages, referencing any relevant issues or tasks. After each commit, update all pertinent documentation (e.g., Changelog, Roadmap, session.md, Tasks, or README files) to reflect the latest code changes.

As you proceed:

1. Document time-based progress on tasks to keep a clear record.  
2. Update “Architecture Decisions” or “Code Changes” as they occur.  
3. Capture any unexpected issues or prospective solutions.  
4. Periodically review .cursorrules to avoid naming or security oversights.  
5. Perform incremental documentation updates whenever a noteworthy change or commit occurs.

Finish this phase by reviewing “Pending Items” and determining your “Next Steps.”

# Prompt 3: Concluding the Session

When concluding your session:

1. Finalize the “Session Summary,” highlighting achievements, remaining tasks, and next-action items.  
2. Commit and push any code changes made during this session.  
3. Verify that pertinent documentation (docs/AI/*.md) is updated or linked accordingly.  
4. Note any newly created or modified tests in the “Testing Updates” section.  
5. If needed, update tasks.md or roadmap files to mark completed items or shift them to pending.  
6. Confirm that all recent commits and their corresponding documentation entries are accurate and complete.  
7. Update CHANGELOG.md to reflect new features, fixes, or important changes introduced in this session.

This process ensures clarity, continuity, and transparency for your current work and for anyone who may reference this session in the future.
