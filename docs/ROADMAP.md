# Roadmap Template

> Quick Reference:
> - Use this file to outline upcoming features, improvements, or scheduled work items.
> - Group items by high-level milestones or releases.
> - Provide target dates or rough timeframes (if applicable).
> - Keep a clear, forward-looking vision to guide development priorities.

> Instructions:
> 1. Maintain one main “Roadmap” section for major milestones and deliverables.  
> 2. Update it frequently to reflect changes in project direction or priorities.  
> 3. Move completed items to a “Done” or “Completed” section at the end of each milestone or sprint.  
> 4. Keep entries succinct, but link to relevant docs or tickets for detailed info.  
> 5. Regularly review and refine the roadmap to match current goals and capacity.  
> 6. Break down each milestone or sprint into phases (e.g., Phase 1, Phase 2) if necessary to give more structure.
